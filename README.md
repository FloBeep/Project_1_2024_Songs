Welcome on the Read Me file for Team 2. 

The team is composed of Ada, Florian and Selina.

The team choose to produce an analysis on a free of rights Music Streaming database for 2024 

The questions we are answering in this analysis are:

1. How does the timing of a track release affect the streaming performance and popularity of a song?  
2. Are there specific artists that perform better across multiple platforms? Explore trends in performance.  
3. Does a trackâ€™s performance on different platforms change when it is classified as explicit? Analyze the metrics for explicit vs non-explicit.  
4. Which tracks achieved the most success across all platforms, and what factors contribute to their cross-platform success?   
5. What is the relationship between Spotify streaming numbers and social media metrics like likes on YouTube and TikTok views, and what part does social media play in the digital music consumption process?
