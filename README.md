Welcome on the Read Me file for Team 2. 

The team is composed of Ada, Florian and Selina.

The team choose to produce an analysis on a free of rights Music Streaming database for 2024 

The questions we are answering in this analysis are:

1. How does the timing of a song release affect popularity on Spotify?
2. Are there specific artists that perform better across multiple platforms?
3. Does a trackâ€™s performance changes when it is classified as explicit?
4. What is the relationship between social media interactions and track performances?
