Welcome on the Read Me file for Team 2. 

The team is composed of Ada, Florian and Selina.

The team choose to produce an analysis on a free of rights Music Streaming database for 2024 

The questions we are answering in this analysis are:

1. How does the timing of a song release affect popularity on Spotify?
2. Are there specific artists that perform better across multiple platforms?
3. Does a trackâ€™s performance changes when it is classified as explicit?
4. What is the relationship between social media interactions and track performances?

Analysis

3. We can see in our analysis that the popularity of Non-Explicit songs is higher than the one of explicit songs for all platform, except for Spotify. Globally, Non-Explicit songs are twice more popular than Explicit songs.

By calculating the T-Stat and the P-values, we were able to confirm that there is no significant difference in any platforms between explicit and non-explicit tracks.
